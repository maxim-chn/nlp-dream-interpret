# nlp-dream-interpret
This is the final project for the NLP course, studied as part of the M.S. degree in "AI systems".

The goal was to perform a research on the effect of fine-tuning pretrained models on their ability to interpret dreams in accordance with primary Freud principles.

A collection of different metrics was used to capture the baseline / "pre fine-tuning" and post fine-tuning performance of the models. These were analysed and explained in the final section of the work.

The complete flow is documented at [ðŸ““ Jupyter Notebook dream_interpret_by_maxim_chanturiay.ipynb](dream_interpret_by_maxim_chanturiay.ipynb).
